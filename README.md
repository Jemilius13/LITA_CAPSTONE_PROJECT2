# LITA_CAPSTONE_PROJECT2
------------------
Introduction to the Capstone Project on Data Analysis. The Capstone Project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative that uses datasets to extract meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making. This project integrates various data analysis tools and techniques, specifically Excel, SQL, and Power BI, to showcase a holistic data management and visualization approach.
Throughout the project, we will work with diverse datasets that require cleaning, manipulation, and analysis to uncover trends and patterns. Utilizing Excel, we will perform initial data exploration and analysis, applying functions and pivot tables to summarize key findings. Next, SQL will be employed for more advanced data querying and management, allowing us to efficiently retrieve and manipulate large datasets from relational databases.
Finally, we will harness the power of Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that present our findings in a user-friendly format. This will enable stakeholders to engage with the data dynamically, facilitating a deeper understanding of the insights derived from the analysis. Overall, this Capstone Project aims to enhance our data analysis skills and demonstrate our ability to effectively utilize analytical tools to solve real-world problems, ultimately contributing to data-driven decision-making processes.

#### PROJECT 2: CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION FOR A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE using EXCEL
-----------------
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI dashboard that presents your analysis.


   - Excel:
     1. Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
     2. Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types.
     3. Create any other interesting reports.

### DATA SOURCES
----------------
The Data sources include the following key points:
   1. Customer_Id: A unique identifier for each customer, linking them to specific orders and other relevant customer details.
   2. CustomerName: The name of the individual or organization that holds the subscription.
   3. Region: The geographical area where the order is placed.
   4. Subscription Type: The category or level of a subscription that a customer purchases, such as "basic," "premium," or "standard."
   5. Subscription Start: The date on which a customer's subscription officially begins.
   6. Subscription End: The date on which a customer's subscription is set to expire, unless renewed.
   7. Canceled: A status indicating whether a subscription has been terminated by the customer or provider before its end date.
   8. Revenue: The total income generated from a customer's subscription over a specific period, often calculated based on the subscription price.
   9. Subscription Duration: The length of time a subscription is active, calculated as the difference between the start and end dates.

These datasets collectively provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and subscription trends, enabling informed decision-making.


### METRICS OF FOCUS
-------------------------
   1. Subscription Patterns: This comprises of the following;
   2. djh
   3. nxn
   4. b h
   5. hvhdc
   6. hbc
   7. Average Subscription duration:
   8. the Most Popular Subscription Type:

### TOOLS USED
----------------------
 - Microsoft Excel: 
    - Pivot Tables: Summarizing data and generating insights based on revenue, units sold, and transaction categories.
    - Formulas and Functions: Calculate performance metrics and automate processes like sorting and filtering.
    - Data Visualizations (Charts, Graphs): To create visual representations of trends, comparisons, and key insights.

### PROJECT 1B: CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION FOR A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE using SQL
---------------------------------
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals.
This project uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to analyze and extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The objective is to showcase how SQL can be used to query, manipulate, and transform data to solve business problems, uncover trends, and generate actionable findings. Working with a structured database, various SQL commands and techniques will be applied, including data filtering, aggregation, joins, and subqueries.

#### TOOLS USED
------------------
Microsoft SQL Management Studio

 ### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
------------------------------------
 1. retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
 2. find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
 3. find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
 4. calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
 5. find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
 6. calculate total revenue by subscription type.
 7. find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
 8. find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
