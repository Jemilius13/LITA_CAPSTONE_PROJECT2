# LITA_CAPSTONE_PROJECT2
------------------
Introduction to the Capstone Project on Data Analysis. The Capstone Project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative that uses datasets to extract meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making. This project integrates various data analysis tools and techniques, specifically Excel, SQL, and Power BI, to showcase a holistic data management and visualization approach.
Throughout the project, we will work with diverse datasets that require cleaning, manipulation, and analysis to uncover trends and patterns. Utilizing Excel, we will perform initial data exploration and analysis, applying functions and pivot tables to summarize key findings. Next, SQL will be employed for more advanced data querying and management, allowing us to efficiently retrieve and manipulate large datasets from relational databases.
Finally, we will harness the power of Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that present our findings in a user-friendly format. This will enable stakeholders to engage with the data dynamically, facilitating a deeper understanding of the insights derived from the analysis. Overall, this Capstone Project aims to enhance our data analysis skills and demonstrate our ability to effectively utilize analytical tools to solve real-world problems, ultimately contributing to data-driven decision-making processes.
